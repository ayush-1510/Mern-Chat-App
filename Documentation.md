# System Overview

The system comprises a client-side application built using React, a server-side application using Node.js and Express, and a MongoDB database for data storage. Real-time communication is facilitated through the use of WebSockets via the Socket.io library.

## 1. System Architecture

### Client-Side Architecture

- **Front-End Framework:** React
- **UI Library:** Chakra UI
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.io-client
- **HTTP Requests:** axios

### Server-Side Architecture

- **Back-End Framework:** Express.js
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.io
- **Database System:** MongoDB
- **User Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## 2. Database Design

#### Database System

- MongoDB is chosen as the database system due to its flexibility and scalability.

## 3. User Authentication and Security

- User authentication is implemented using JWT for secure token-based authentication.
- bcrypt is used for hashing user passwords to ensure data security.

## 4. Client-Side Components

- Key React components include the chat interface, message input field, and user authentication components.
- Real-time messaging is achieved through Socket.io-client.
- Chakra UI is used for creating a visually appealing user interface.

## 5. Server-Side Components

- API endpoints are designed to manage user authentication, chat messages, and chat groups.
- Socket.io is employed to handle real-time messaging between clients.
- Error handling includes middleware to catch and respond to errors gracefully.
